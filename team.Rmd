### Alex Tremblay
#### Financial Manager
Alex has a background in classical French cuisine, ecology and native habitat restoration. He has an A.S. in Culinary Arts and a B.S. in Environmental Studies with a focus in terrestrial ecology, community sustainability and professional writing from the University of California Santa Barbara. As a chef, he was concerned about the environmental impacts from the national food system and emphasized the use of local, sustainable ingredients in menu design. He returned to college with a strong interest in working on environmental issues. As an ecological field coordinator, he managed native habitat restoration projects, specifically seasonal wetland and associated upland ecosystems. His focus of study at the Bren School is Pollution Prevention <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Remediation. He hopes to work  with companies and community organizations to reduce the pollution footprint of <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; industrial and urban activities.

### Thomas Dunne
#### Faculty Advisor
Thomas Dunne conducts field and theoretical research in fluvial geomorphology and in the application of hydrology, sediment transport, and geomorphology to landscape management and hazard analysis. Since coming to the Bren School in 1996, Professor Dunne has studied erosion in the Andes, and hydrology, sediment transport, and floodplain sedimentation in the Amazon River basin of Brazil and Bolivia and the Central Valley of California.

### Colleen Devlin
#### PhD Advisor
Colleen Devlin is a second year PhD student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. Concentrating in political science, she examines the nexus of foreign aid, community empowerment, and natural resources in the Horn of Africa.  Prior to arriving at Bren, she was involved in integrated water resource management research in the oases villages of Egypt's Western Desert.

### Frank Davis 
#### External Advisor
Frank Davis brings conservation science and geographical analysis to bear in land use planning and the conservation of wild species. Davis heads the Biogeography Lab at the Bren School, and his research focuses on the landscape ecology of California plant communities, the design of protected-area network, rangeland and farmland conservation, and the biological implications of regional climate change.

### Christina (Naomi) Tague
#### External Advisor 
Naomi's research is focused on the interactions between hydrology and ecosystem processes and, specifically, how eco-hydrologic systems are altered by changes in land use and climate. Much of her work involves developing and using spatial simulation models to integrate data from multiple field-based monitoring studies in order to generalize results to larger watersheds. Professor Tague is currently modeling the impacts of climate change on stream-flow patterns in the western United States and examining how urbanization alters drainage patterns and associated biogeochemical cycling in watersheds in Baltimore, Maryland, and Southern California.
