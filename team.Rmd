#### Project Manager
Elise is interested in remediation programs associated with technological advances.

She has a strong analytical streak, and is a capable programmer, wet-bench chemist, and visual artist. Her skills include: Global and U.S. Federal Chemical Regulatory Compliance, Wet/Bench Chemistry and Protocol Design, Data Analysis, Database Management, Process Automation, and Scientific Instrument Operations and Repair.
