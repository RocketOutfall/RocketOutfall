She recieved her B.S. in Biological Chemistry from Beloit College, and is pursuing a Master's focus in Pollution Prevention and Remediation at UCSB's Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. She has three years of professional experience dealing with Global and U.S. Federal Chemical Regulatory Compliance, Wet/Bench Chemistry and Protocol Design, Data Analysis, Database Management, Process Automation, and Scientific Instrument Operations and Repair.
