### Mission Statement
##### Our team is determining the best way to deal with purified groundwater at the former Santa Susana Field Laboratory, and developing tools that can be used broadly to solve similar water discharge problems. The project's primary goal is the evaluation and mitigation of environmental impacts from the continual discharge of this treated groundwater at Outfall 2, located in the Bell Canyon watershed.
